\section{Proposed Solution}
Considering the limitations of exsisting systems, it seems obvious that we need to have a better system. We have developed a simple 
mobile application and helps farmers with learning about their crops, diagnose any crop diseases without having to waste their resources
on futile solutions.\par
Automatic Plant/Disease Identification is the most promising solution that can be used to partially solve this problem. Solving the entire
problem requires an update of basic infastructure and education. Saying that, this is a small starting step to that future.\par
Improving the performance of the Mobile-based plant identification helps users identify the crop and obtain the information about the 
crop/crop disease\par
