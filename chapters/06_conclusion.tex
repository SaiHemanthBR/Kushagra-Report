\chapter{Conclusion \& Future Scope}

``Automation'' is the frequent word being used in this decade. This project has been designed with a vision of the automation of farming, 
which promotes the usage of advanced machinery in agriculture. Farmer's economic growth depends on the quality of the products they produce, 
which relies on the plant's growth and the yield they get. With the need to move to environmental and sustainable future more than ever 
before, we need to find ways to produce good healthy food to feed the growing population.\par

We used CNN model for crop/disease detection, and have achieved an accuracy of 92\% for crop detection and 90\% for disease detection. But 
with more research in computer vision, more sophisticated model will be developed and that inevitably leads to better automation and better
food production. So the short term goal is to improve the AI model, to work with more crops and increased accuracy.\par

The long term goal is to integrate this with an automated crop management system. This will create an end-to-end automated food production
system, that can make better, healthy food with less resources, less carbon footprint and essentially zero pesticides and fertilizers. 
People will be able to order food on their mobile and receive freshly harvested food at their door step in less than an hour.
