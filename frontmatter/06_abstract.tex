    \textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

India is an agricultural economy, with most of the population's livelihood is directly or indirectly associated with farming. Since late 
1960s technology has advanced at an exponential rate but that advancements haven't improved farming. With the pressure to move to
sustainable, green future, we need to advance farming techniques to improve energy requirements for farming, its carbon footprint, etc. \par

This project is an attempt at solving a small piece of that puzzle. Using AI to provide farmers with information, suggestions, precautions,
and educate farmers, we can empower the farmers to help themselves.\par

The proposed model is currently targeted to support farmers, to educate them, give them information about their crops and diseases. This 
is created such that it can improve over time with new additional data and is developed using real-world data
